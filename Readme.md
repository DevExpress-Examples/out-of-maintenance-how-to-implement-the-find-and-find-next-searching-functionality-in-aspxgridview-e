# How to implement the "Find" and "Find Next" searching functionality in ASPxGridView


<p><strong>UPDATED:<br /></strong><br />Starting with version 14.2, GridView provides the built-in Search / Find Panel functionality with the capability to locate it outside grid boundaries. This allows accomplishing a similar task with less effort and does not require so much extra code. See the <a href="https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2014/11/19/asp-net-data-grid-enhancements-coming-soon-in-v14-2.aspx">ASP.NET Data Grid: Enhancements</a>Â post to learn more about this new functionality.<br /><br />This example demonstrates how to implement the searching functionality in ASPxGridView.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Note</strong> that this approach has some limitations:</p>
<p>- It works only for rows that are currently visible in the GridView. So, it works only for expanded group rows.</p>
<p>- It performs searching only in cell values. So, it will not work for cells with a custom text or for the ComboBox column's TextField values.</p>
<p>- As the String.Contains method is used for search, the search is case-sensitive.</p>
